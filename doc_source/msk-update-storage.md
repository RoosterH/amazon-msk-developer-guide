# Scaling up broker storage<a name="msk-update-storage"></a>

You can increase the amount of EBS storage per broker\. You can't decrease the storage\. 

Storage volumes remain available during this scaling\-up operation\.

**Important**  
When storage is scaled for an MSK cluster, the additional storage is made available right away\. However, the cluster requires a cool\-down period after every storage scaling event\. Amazon MSK uses this cool\-down period to optimize the cluster before it can be scaled again\. This period can range from a minimum of 6 hours to over 24 hours, depending on the clusterâ€™s storage size and utilization and on traffic\. This is applicable for both auto scaling events and manual scaling using the [UpdateBrokerStorage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/1.0/apireference/clusters-clusterarn-nodes-storage.html#UpdateBrokerStorage) operation\. For information about right\-sizing your storage, see [Best Practices](bestpractices.md)\.
