# Getting started using MSK Serverless clusters<a name="serverless-getting-started"></a>

This tutorial shows you an example of how you can create an MSK Serverless cluster, create a client machine that can access it, and use the client to create topics on the cluster and to write data to those topics\. This exercise doesn't represent all the options that you can choose when you create a serverless cluster\. In different parts of this exercise, we choose default options for simplicity\. This doesn't mean that they're the only options that work for setting up a serverless cluster\. You can also use the AWS CLI or the Amazon MSK API\. For more information, see the [Amazon MSK API Reference 2\.0](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/MSK/2.0/APIReference/what-is-msk.html)\.
