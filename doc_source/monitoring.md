# Monitoring an Amazon MSK cluster<a name="monitoring"></a>

Amazon MSK gathers Apache Kafka metrics and sends them to Amazon CloudWatch where you can view them\. For more information about Apache Kafka metrics, including the ones that Amazon MSK surfaces, see [Monitoring](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#monitoring) in the Apache Kafka documentation\.

You can also monitor your MSK cluster with Prometheus, an open\-source monitoring application\. For information about Prometheus, see [Overview](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) in the Prometheus documentation\. To learn how to monitor your cluster with Prometheus, see [Open monitoring with Prometheus](open-monitoring.md)\.
