For a list of these resources and the operations that you can invoke on them, see [Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/1.0/apireference/resources.html) in the Amazon MSK API Reference\. In the context of [IAM access control](iam-access-control.md), a resource is an entity to which you can allow or deny access, as defined in the [Resources](iam-access-control.md#msk-iam-resources) section\.
